# Attendance Scanner Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified

The attendance scanner had several issues that prevented it from properly connecting to admin and HR attendance records:

1. **Wrong API Endpoint**: The scanner was trying to use `../master/api/attendance/scan.php` which doesn't exist
2. **Incorrect Integration**: It wasn't using the existing attendance system logic
3. **Missing Context**: No proper connection to admin/HR portals
4. **Wrong Payload Format**: Sending incompatible data format to the backend

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Integration
- **Before**: Used non-existent `scan.php` endpoint
- **After**: Integrates directly with existing `api/attendance.php` endpoint using proper operations

### 2. Implemented Proper Attendance Logic
- **Before**: Sent raw scan data without validation
- **After**: Uses the same logic as admin/HR modules:
  - Validates employee leave status
  - Handles undertime requests
  - Enforces shift timing rules (8:00 AM - 8:00 PM)
  - Auto-determines time-in vs time-out

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Before**: Basic scanning with limited feedback
- **After**: 
  - Shows employee names in feedback
  - Provides detailed status messages
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Audio feedback for different scenarios

### 4. Updated Configuration
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  baseApiUrl: window.baseApiUrl || `${location.origin}/intro/api`,
  adminAttendanceUrl: 'master/admin/admin.html',
  hrAttendanceUrl: 'master/hr/hr.html',
  context: 'standalone',
  useHtml5QrcodeScanner: false
};
```

## Key Changes Made

### File: `js/qrcode/attendance-scanner.js`
1. **New Helper Functions**:
   - `parseEmployeeIdFromText()` - Extract employee ID from QR codes
   - `today()` - Get current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - `nowHHMM()` - Get current time in HH:MM format
   - `buildFormData()` - Create FormData for API calls
   - `compareTimesHHMM()` - Compare time strings

2. **Enhanced `recordScan()` Function**:
   - Validates employee leave status
   - Checks for approved undertime
   - Enforces shift timing rules
   - Handles time-in/time-out logic properly
   - Returns detailed response with action and message

3. **Improved `handleScan()` Function**:
   - Fetches employee names for better feedback
   - Provides detailed status messages
   - Color-codes responses based on action type
   - Handles all attendance scenarios

### File: `attendance-scanner.html`
1. **Updated Header**: Added navigation links to Admin and HR portals
2. **Simplified Scan Modes**: 
   - Auto mode (recommended) - automatically determines time-in/time-out
   - Force Time In/Out options for manual override
3. **Better Labels**: More descriptive text and placeholders

## How It Works Now

### Scanning Process
1. **QR Code Detection**: Supports both JSON format and plain employee IDs
2. **Employee Validation**: Fetches employee details for feedback
3. **Attendance Logic**: 
   - New employees → Records time-in
   - Existing time-in → Records time-out (with timing validation)
   - Completed attendance → Shows completion message
4. **Business Rules**: 
   - Time-in allowed until 8:00 PM
   - Time-out allowed from 8:00 PM to 8:30 PM
   - Leave validation prevents attendance when on approved leave
   - Undertime handling with automatic time-out

### Integration Points
- **Admin Portal**: Links to `master/admin/admin.html`
- **HR Portal**: Links to `master/hr/hr.html`
- **API Endpoints**: Uses existing `api/attendance.php`, `api/employees.php`, `api/leaves.php`, `api/undertime.php`
- **Database**: Records to the same `tblattendance` table as admin/HR modules

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Setup
- Ensure XAMPP is running with Apache and MySQL
- Database should have employee records and attendance table structure

### 2. Access Scanner
- Open browser to `http://localhost/intro/attendance-scanner.html`
- Allow camera permissions when prompted

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario A: New Time-In
1. Scan employee QR code before 8:00 PM
2. Should record time-in with "present" or "late" status
3. Should show employee name and success message

#### Scenario B: Time-Out
1. After employee has time-in, scan again after 8:00 PM
2. Should record time-out
3. Should show completion message

#### Scenario C: Employee on Leave
1. Ensure employee has approved leave for today
2. Scan employee QR code
3. Should show leave message and prevent attendance

#### Scenario D: Manual Entry
1. Enter employee ID in manual entry field
2. Click "Record Attendance"
3. Should process same as QR scan

### 4. Verify in Admin/HR Portals
- Check attendance records in admin or HR portals
- Verify data consistency across systems

## Security and Validation

- **Leave Validation**: Prevents attendance when employee is on approved leave
- **Timing Enforcement**: Enforces business hours for time-in/time-out
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate scans within 5 seconds
- **Data Validation**: Validates employee IDs and handles errors gracefully

## Maintenance Notes

- Scanner now uses the same logic as admin/HR modules
- Any changes to attendance business rules should be applied to all modules
- Configuration can be adjusted in the CONFIG object at the top of the JS file
- Error handling provides clear feedback for troubleshooting
